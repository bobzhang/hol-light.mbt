# HOL Light → MoonBit port plan

Upstream: `.repos/hol-light` (jrh13/hol-light @ `cba9198`), not tracked in this repo.

## Goals and decisions

- **Scope:** everything, incrementally. First the full `hol.ml` load sequence
  (~56K lines in the root dir), then `Library/`, `Multivariate/`, and the rest
  (~1.2M lines in total).
- **Targets:** `wasm` (linear memory) is the primary target, and every
  package must pass `moon test --target wasm`. `native` comes later. Keep
  packages target-agnostic: no FFI and no async in core packages. Day to
  day the theory tests run on `wasm-gc`, where they take a fifth of the
  time (see Verification); results must not depend on the target.
- **Small trusted kernel:** only `kernel/` (a port of `fusion.ml`) is trusted.
  It depends only on `moonbitlang/core` and uses the builtin `Failure` error.
  The `lib.ml` helpers it needs (`union`, `subtract`, `qmap`, `rev_assocd`, …)
  are private copies inside `kernel/`, so the audited trusted code is
  exactly that package. `HolType` and `Term` are read-only enums (they can be
  matched but not constructed outside the kernel), so every term is well
  typed. `Thm`
  has private fields, so the 10 primitive rules plus the axiom and definition
  functions are the only way to make a theorem. Everything else (lib, parser,
  tactics, decision procedures, theories) is untrusted and goes through the
  kernel API.
- **Review:** each commit gets `codex review --commit <sha>` (model
  `gpt-6-astra`, reasoning effort high). Valid findings
  are fixed in a follow-up commit, and disagreements are escalated.

## Trust boundary (kernel hardening)

- **Encapsulation:** `HolType`/`Term` are read-only enums and `Thm` has
  private fields. `tools/check_kernel_encapsulation.sh` checks that outside
  code cannot construct or update them. Never add `FromJson`, `Default`,
  arbitrary generators or deserializers for kernel types, because derives
  run with kernel privileges. The trusted base also includes the MoonBit
  compiler, `moonbitlang/core` and the absence of `%identity`/FFI casts
  in linked code.
- **Atomic extensions:** `new_basic_definition` and
  `new_basic_type_definition` run every check and build their theorems
  before publishing anything. Upstream can leave a registered type behind
  when `absname == repname`; the port cannot.
- **Fail closed:** the kernel's `abort` calls cover invariants that
  well-typed terms guarantee (operators have function types, binders are
  variables, clashes do not escape `inst`). None of them silently continues.
- **Axioms:** as upstream, `new_axiom` is unrestricted (`mk_thm` relies on
  it). `axioms()` is the audit trail, and `@testkit.check_axioms` (only
  `INFINITY_AX`, `SELECT_AX` and `ETA_AX` allowed, each once) runs at the end
  of every generated theory-load test (the template in
  tools/ocaml_ref/theory.py).
- **Traps:** a wasm trap (for example a stack overflow) during an extension
  leaves the store as it was at the trap. A trapped instance must be
  discarded, not resumed. Inference rules have no side effects, so a trap
  there produces no theorem.
- **Tests:** OCaml differential suite; failed-extension state snapshots;
  property tests on generated well-typed terms (capture avoidance, type
  preservation, alpha-order laws, sorted duplicate-free hypotheses); deep
  binders, operator spines and types.

## Semantic hazards (OCaml → MoonBit)

| Hazard | Decision |
|---|---|
| Polymorphic `compare` on terms, types and strings. MoonBit `String::compare` puts shorter strings first (`"b" < "aa"`), while OCaml compares byte by byte. This is load-bearing: the kernel sorts hypotheses with `alphaorder`, and `setify` and `sort` change output order. | Write `Compare` by hand to reproduce OCaml's order: constructor tag first, then fields from left to right, `[] < _::_`, and strings compared by code point (the same as UTF-8 byte order). Never use derived `Compare` or `String::compare` where OCaml's order matters. |
| `string` | HOL names and quotations are ASCII text, so use `String`. The only byte-level places are char/string theories (`mk_char`, `Library/strings`), which get explicit byte helpers. |
| OCaml `list` and physical-equality sharing (`==`) in `qmap`, `vsubst`, `inst`, `term_image` | Use the immutable `@list.List[T]` and `physical_equal`. Lists keep their order exactly as in OCaml (for example `constants()` returns the newest first). |
| `Failure`, `try … with Failure _`, `can`, `Unchanged`, `Match_failure` | Use the builtin `Failure(String)`. Every fallible HOL function is declared plain `raise`, kernel included, because a `raise Failure` function value is not accepted where a `raise` callback is expected, and HOL passes rules around as values everywhere. Catch sites match `Failure(_)` and re-raise everything else (`e => raise e`), like OCaml's `with Failure _`. `Unchanged`, `MatchFailure`, `InvalidArgument` and `DivisionByZero` are separate `pub(all)` error types. |
| Deep recursion. Both wasm and wasm-gc overflow somewhere between 10K and 30K frames. | List utilities use loops or `@list` builtins. Recursion over terms is **not** assumed safe: there are stress tests for deep combinations, binders and long lists, and explicit work stacks are added where needed. |
| Evaluation order. OCaml 4.14 evaluates tuples, function arguments, constructor arguments, list literals and binary operators right to left. But `let … and …` and `match (e1, e2) with` (where the tuple is never built) go left to right. MoonBit is always left to right. | Whenever the parts have effects (fresh names, registration, exceptions), write the order out explicitly. Library callback order follows `lib.ml` exactly: `map` runs head-first, `filter`/`mapfilter` tail-first. |
| OCaml 63-bit `int` vs MoonBit 32-bit `Int` | OCaml `int` is `Int64` with exact 63-bit semantics (lib/int63.mbt) in translated code and in OCaml-visible data; `Int` only for indexes and bounded internals, converted with a range check at the boundary. |
| `Hashtbl.hash` decides the tree shape of the `lib.ml` Patricia maps (`func`, `\|->`), and so their fold and `choose` order | Implement an OCaml-compatible `caml_hash` (MurmurHash3, limits 10/256) for the key types used (strings, ints, terms, types, tuples) and test it against OCaml values. Keep `Hashtbl` duplicate-binding semantics. |
| Callback effect types | Combinators that only propagate errors take `raise?` callbacks, which accept any function value. Combinators that catch `Failure` (`can`, `repeat`, `tryfind`, `splitlist`, `find_term`, …) take `raise` callbacks, and a named non-raising function must be passed as a lambda (`t => is_var(t)`). The translator always eta-expands function arguments. |
| Physical equality `==` | Use `physical_equal` only as a sharing optimization. Results must be structurally identical whether it returns true or false. |
| Alpha order vs structural order | They are kept separate: `alphaorder` puts `Const < Var < Comb < Abs`, while structural `compare` uses the constructor order `Var < Const < Comb < Abs`. |
| `Lazy` (thecops), exceptions other than `Failure` (`Unchanged`, `Noparse`, `Not_found`) | Port to `Lazy`-like explicit cells and separate `suberror`s. `can`/`try … with Failure _` catch only `Failure`. `abort` is used only for states the kernel makes impossible. |
| `Num` / Zarith bignums and rationals | `num/` implements arbitrary-precision rationals on top of `@bigint`, matching the `Num` operations HOL uses (`quo_num`/`mod_num` sign rules, `string_of_num`, …). |
| `Format` pretty printing | Port a minimal OCaml `Format` box engine (`pp/`) so that printer output matches byte for byte. |
| Term quotations `` `...` `` (camlp5 `pa_j`) | Becomes a call to the parser on a string (`@parser.parse_term("...")`). Type quotations `` `:ty` `` become `parse_type`. |
| `Hashtbl.hash`-dependent order | Where iteration order changes results, use insertion-ordered `Map` and check against the reference output. |

## Naming

MoonBit treats uppercase identifiers as constructors, so HOL's UPPERCASE
values (rules, tactics, conversions, theorems) become lowercase:
`REFL` → `refl`, `EQ_MP` → `eq_mp`, `ADD_SYM` → `add_sym`. When the
lowercase name collides with an existing lowercase HOL/OCaml identifier
or a MoonBit keyword, a suffix based on the kind is added: `_rule` for
inference rules, `_thm` for theorems, `_conv` for conversions, `_tac` for
tactics. Kernel examples: `MK_COMB` → `mk_comb_rule`, `INST` → `inst_rule`,
`ABS` → `abs_rule`, `ASSUME` → `assume_rule` (`assume` is reserved). Doc
comments name the original HOL identifier.

## Package layout (each package follows one HOL file or a few adjacent ones)

```
kernel/    fusion.ml               ← TRUSTED, kept minimal
lib/       lib.ml                  general utilities (untrusted)
num/       Num replacement on @bigint
pp/        OCaml Format subset
basics/    basics.ml, nets.ml
printer/   printer.ml
parser/    preterm.ml, parser.ml
equal/ … drule/ tactics/ simp/ …   one package per layer, in hol.ml load order
theories/… generated or hand-ported theory scripts
```

### Theory loading (decided with Codex guidance)

MoonBit does not reliably evaluate side-effecting top-level `let`s (unused
globals are dropped), and upstream's load-time effects are ordered:
definitions register constants, quotations advance the type-variable and
`GEN%PVAR` counters, and partially applied rules precompute theorems. So:

- Each theory package runs upstream's load-time steps in its `fn init`
  (suggested by the user). A probe confirmed that `fn init` runs for every
  imported package, even when nothing in it is used, in dependency order,
  and also in tests. Importing a theory therefore loads it, like `needs`.
  The canonical order comes from the import chain: each theory imports the
  previous one in `hol_lib.ml` order. A failed load aborts. The steps are
  every eager upstream computation, in order: definitions, quotations,
  syntax changes, closure set-up, and discarded results too.
- Theorems and precomputed proof steps are stored in write-once
  `@lib.Cell`s, exposed as typed accessors (`@bool.t_def()`). Rules are
  plain functions that read those cells.
- Effectful expressions are lowered to explicit temporaries in the pinned
  OCaml 4.14 evaluation order: arguments and tuples right to left,
  `let … and …` and `match (…)` left to right.
- The parser records the quotations each theory parses while loading
  (`@parser.theory_trace(name)`).
- On wasm, writing to stdout inside `fn init` traps (native is fine). So
  `begin_theory` holds stdout lines back (`@pp.defer_stdout`) until
  `end_theory`. The held-back lines are printed before the next line of
  output after initialisation (or by `@pp.flush_stdout_backlog()`), and are
  kept per theory for tests (`@parser.theory_output(name)`).
- Load-fidelity tests compare, after loading each file in a fresh process:
  the three counters (types, `GEN%PVAR`, `genvar`), `types()`,
  `constants()`, `definitions()`, `axioms()`, warnings, and structural
  theorem representations.
- Startup optimization (proof-DAG replay through the kernel, never raw
  theorem deserialization) comes after the eager baseline is measured.

## Proof scripts strategy

1. **Engine (hand-ported, idiomatic):** every file that mostly defines ML
   functions (rules, conversions, tactics, decision procedures, `define`,
   `ind_types`, …).
2. **Theory scripts (translated by a tool):** most of the remaining lines are
   `let NAME = prove(`…`, TAC)` and `new_definition` calls. Write a
   translator in OCaml using `compiler-libs`. It works on the camlp5-expanded,
   type-checked AST, so it has full type information (MoonBit needs types on
   top-level functions). It emits MoonBit; the output is spot-checked and
   fixed by hand where needed. **Built for theorems.ml** (tools/translator,
   driven by tools/ocaml_ref/translate.sh):
   - Upstream files load phrase by phrase in a live toplevel (camlp5 +
     pa_j + compiler-libs). Each phrase is typechecked, translated, then
     executed; the installed stamps record which file defined each value
     (provenance), which resolves to a MoonBit package and declaration read
     from its `pkg.generated.mbti` (names: lowercase plus `_rule`/`_thm`/
     `_conv`/`_tac`/`_tcl` on clashes).
   - Lowering keeps OCaml 4.14's evaluation order: all ordered siblings
     but the last (in OCaml order) are bound to temporaries; arguments are
     evaluated before any stage call; tuple-scrutinee matches go left to
     right.
   - Calls are aligned with MoonBit parameter groups from the declared
     OCaml type: a group of k > 1 takes k curried arguments or one k-tuple.
     Function values are adapted to the expected MoonBit type by
     eta-expansion that applies each stage as soon as its arguments arrive,
     so staging is preserved. `o`/`I`/`K`/`C`/`W`/`F_F` are expanded inline.
   - Theorems and other values become write-once cells with accessors; set
     in `load_steps()` in source order. Syntactic functions become `pub fn`.
   - Engine phrases are ported by hand and named in the manifest
     (tools/translator/main.ml), which calls their setup at the upstream
     position.
3. Optionally later: a small ML-subset interpreter or REPL for interactive use.

## Verification

- **Reference outputs:** run real HOL Light (OCaml 4.14 and camlp5 are
  installed locally) and dump `name: string_of_thm` for every theorem a file
  defines, plus selected printer and parser cases. The MoonBit port must
  match these exactly.
- Unit tests ported from `UnitTests/`. Kernel tests cover every rule's
  success and failure cases.
- Every commit must pass `moon check --target wasm`, `tools/test.py`
  (the hand-ported core on wasm and wasm-gc, seconds), `moon fmt` and
  `moon info`; a change to a theory, the translator or the engine also the
  tiers it touches (`tools/test.py core|library|multivariate|100|all`, on
  wasm-gc). A file's test loads everything before it in a fresh process;
  the files of a load order (a make.ml) are test blocks of one package,
  run in order in one process with their goldens unchanged (the blocks
  read the counters without advancing them: tools/ocaml_ref/chain_test.py).
  `tools/test.py all --target wasm` (the primary target) is for releases. `--shard I/N` splits a selection across machines,
  balanced by tools/test_times.tsv.

## Phases

0. Scaffold, plan and `.gitignore` (upstream excluded).
1. `kernel/` (`fusion.ml`), with exhaustive kernel tests and deep-term
   stress tests.
2. Reference harness (OCaml dump of theorems, registries and printer
   output), `lib/` (`lib.ml`, including OCaml-compatible hashing and
   `func`), and `num/`.
3. `basics/`, `nets/`, `pp/`, `printer/`, `preterm/`, `parser/`, plus an
   early translator spike on `pair.ml`.
4. `equal`, `bool`, `drule`, `tactics`, `itab`, `simp`, `theorems`,
   `ind_defs`, `class`, `trivia`, `canon`, `meson`, `firstorder`, `metis`,
   `thecops`, `quot`, `impconv`.
5. `pair` … `realarith` … `sets`, `iterate`, `cart`, `define`, … (the rest
   of `hol.ml`), plus the translator spike.
6. `Library/`, `Multivariate/`, and the other subdirectories, incrementally.
7. Add the `native` target and performance work.

## Progress log

- [x] Phase 0: scaffold, plan, OCaml reference harness (`tools/ocaml_ref`:
  builds `pa_j` for camlp5 8.00, loads upstream sources, emits reference
  output that is embedded into MoonBit tests with `embed_golden.py`).
- [x] Phase 1: `kernel/` matches `fusion.ml` on 56 differential checks
  (`kernel/kernel_ref_test.mbt`).
  Known limit: with the default wasm stack (984 KB) recursive kernel
  operations handle terms nested about 2500 deep in debug builds
  (`vsubst_rec` overflows first). `moonrun --stack-size 4000` makes depth
  3000+ work. Mitigations, if real theories need them: run the CLI through
  `moonrun --stack-size`, or rewrite the hot paths with explicit stacks.
  The Codex review found no soundness issues; the sharing fixes for `qmap`,
  `filter` and `term_image` are applied.
- [ ] Phase 2: `num/` is done (it matches OCaml `Num` and the `lib.ml` num
  helpers on 270 differential checks plus 12 bit-exact `float_of_num`
  cases; `int_of_num` is limited to 32 bits by design, and `int64_of_num`
  covers wider values). `lib/` is done: `OCompare`/`OHash` reproduce OCaml
  `compare` and `Hashtbl.hash` (35 hash values match), and `lib.ml`
  including the Patricia `func` matches on 68 differential checks that also
  compare callback order. Not yet ported: `time` (needs a clock and OCaml
  float formatting) and the file helpers (`strings_of_file` etc.), which
  wait for an I/O package.
- [ ] Phase 3: `basics/` is done (basics.ml plus the untrusted tail of
  fusion.ml; it matches basics.ml on 79 differential checks, including
  hash-ordered `atoms`, `genvar` counters and capture-avoiding `subst`).
  `nets/` is done (persistent term nets with `NetCompare`, which models
  OCaml `compare` raising on closures; it matches nets.ml on 28 lookups,
  including closure-ordered tips and merges). `pp/` is done: a port of
  OCaml 4.14's Format engine; 300 random box/break documents at several
  margins and max-box limits match OCaml byte for byte (5,766 lines).
  `printer/` is done: printer.ml plus the parse-status tables; it matches
  upstream on 73 hand-built cases (types, infix precedence and
  associativity, binders, sets, comprehensions, let, conditionals,
  character strings, decimals, interface reversal, theorems, wrapping at
  margins 78 and 30). Known difference: standard output is line-based, so
  `print_flush` on `std_formatter` ends a partial line with a newline.
  `preterm/` and `parser/` are done: typechecking with overload
  resolution, then the lexer and combinator grammar. The lexer is a loop,
  and the grammar uses the same combinators as upstream so that
  backtracking re-runs actions identically. They match upstream on
  `tools/ocaml_ref/parse_cases.txt` (186 outputs: types, terms, structure
  with invented type-variable numbers, `GEN%PVAR` numbering, overloading
  across num/int/real, warnings and error messages, wrapping).
  Phase 3 is complete.
- [ ] Phase 4: `equal/` is done (conversions as `Conv = (Term) -> Thm raise`
  closures, conversionals, depth conversions with upstream's exact `try`
  scopes, `CACHE_CONV` with OCaml closure-compare semantics in nets; it
  matches equal.ml on 62 checks, including callback order). `bool/` is done:
  the first theory with `load()`. Definitions and the precomputed rule
  theorems are in write-once cells, quotations are parsed in OCaml's
  evaluation order, and it matches bool.ml on 79 checks, including the
  constants, definitions, parse tables, interface and all three counters
  after loading. `testkit/` holds the shared test helpers. `drule/` is done
  (matching, unification, instantiation, PART_MATCH/MATCH_MP with
  upstream's staging, which return closures, and new_definition; it
  matches drule.ml including the load trace and counters).
  Test-writing rule: the OCaml reference scripts bind effectful arguments
  with explicit `let`s, because OCaml evaluates the script's own arguments
  right to left. `tactics/` is done: goals, goalstates and justifications
  as closures, THEN/THENL with OCaml's right-to-left justification order,
  the theorem tacticals, the goal printers, `prove`, and the interactive
  goalstack (`g`/`e`/`r`/`b`/`er`). It matches tactics.ml on 130 checks,
  including the load trace, failure messages, goal printing and counters.
  Infix tacticals that collide with keywords are `then_tac` and
  `orelse_tac`; `lib.time` reads a pluggable `cpu_time` clock (0 on wasm).
  `itab/` is done (ITAUT_TAC, UNIFY_ACCEPT_TAC, UNIFY_REFL_TAC; matches
  itab.ml on ten ITAUT proofs and the metavariable goalstack). `simp/` is
  done: rewrite nets of `Gconv` (priority plus closure, compared as OCaml
  compares closures), mk_rewrites, the simpset strategies with upstream's
  try scopes, basic rewrites, convs and congruences, staged
  REWRITE/SIMP rules and tactics, ABBREV_TAC and EXPAND_TAC. It matches
  simp.ml on 60 checks, including the load output. `theorems/` is done:
  the first file produced by the translator (66 theorems, AC, CLAIM_TAC,
  the basic rewrites and congruences), with the DESTRUCT/FIX/INTRO/HYP_TAC
  block ported by hand. It matches theorems.ml exactly: every theorem, the
  77-quotation load trace, load output, rewrite registries, the pattern
  tactics on goals, and the counters. `ind_defs/` is done, entirely
  translated (engine code: local `let rec`, polymorphic helpers lifted to
  generic top-level functions, tuple bindings of closures, refs); it
  matches ind_defs.ml on inductive definitions (schematic, mutual, nested
  quantifiers, redefinition), strong induction, the helpers, registries
  and counters. `class/` is done, entirely translated (43 theorems,
  SELECT/ETA/TAUT/COND tools, new_type_definition); it matches class.ml
  exactly. Translator additions on the way: a MoonBit group aligns with
  OCaml arguments by exact unit counts (spreading tuple arguments, e.g.
  `new_basic_type_definition tyname (abs, rep) th`), a package's own
  unqualified types are qualified, and the last definition of a redefined
  name (TAUT) gets the plain MoonBit name. `trivia/` and `canon/` are
  done, entirely translated, and match upstream (17 trivia theorems; NNF,
  CNF/DNF, PRENEX, SKOLEM and friends). Each phrase's load work is its own
  `step_N` function. Mutually recursive local functions are lambda-lifted
  to top-level functions (captures become parameters): large `letrec`
  closures hit a MoonBit compiler bug (native ICE "unbound scalar", bad
  pointer at run time on debug wasm). Polymorphic local functions are
  lifted when they capture nothing, else monomorphised at their instance.
  `meson/` is done, entirely translated (the translator now handles type
  declarations as `pub(all) enum ... derive(Eq, Debug)` with generated
  OCaml-order `OCompare`/`OHash` impls, exceptions as `suberror`s, and
  modules flattened into the package with `Module.x` provenance); MESON
  proofs and their progress output match upstream. `firstorder/` is done,
  entirely translated (nested modules, `include List`, Stdlib `List.*`
  mapped to lib functions with Stdlib semantics, printf with literal
  formats, `assert`, floats, operators named `op_...`). Records are
  supported (structs, OCaml's right-to-left field order, patterns,
  `{r with ...}`, mutable fields, generated OCompare/OHash).
  **Deferred: `metis.ml` and `thecops.ml`.** They are module-heavy programs
  (functors `Mmap.Make`/`Mset.Make` over OCaml's `Map.Make`/`Set.Make`,
  `include`/`open` of applications); they need functor instantiation in the
  translator and an ordered Map/Set in MoonBit. METIS is first used in
  arith.ml (3 times), so they come before that file. Until then later
  packages and their reference scripts skip both. `quot/` and `impconv/`
  are done, entirely translated, and match upstream (quotient types,
  lifted functions and theorems; IMP_REWRITE_TAC, SEQ_/CASE_/TARGET_
  rewriting, HINT_EXISTS_TAC). impconv needed local modules and module
  aliases, types declared in local modules, polymorphic local functions
  lifted to generic top-level functions (captured locals are passed at
  the instance used), local function-valued lets annotated with partial
  types (`_` for unknown parts), and type variable names past `TZ`.
  Generated packages also write `translated_names.txt` (a module member's
  qualified name -> its MoonBit name), which later translations consult,
  so `A.f` and `B.f` stay distinct across packages. `metis/` is done,
  entirely translated (28k lines of MoonBit) and matches upstream on
  METIS_TAC proofs (first-order, equality, lemmas, ASM_METIS_TAC). On the
  way: functor applications are specialized before typechecking (each
  `F (A)` becomes a structure aliasing the parameter to A followed by F's
  body, with hygiene for free modules and values); Stdlib Map.Make and
  Set.Make become wrappers over `omap`/`oset`, OCaml 4.14's Map/Set code
  with an explicit comparison (checked to build Stdlib's exact trees and
  call callbacks in the same order); OCaml 4.14's Random (with the MD5
  seeding `Random.init` uses) and List.sort are ported exactly; module
  members resolve through recorded module paths; exceptions get distinct
  suberrors; lambdas with known types are annotated raising `fn`s.
  `thecops/` is done, entirely translated, and matches upstream on
  LEANCOP_TAC and NANOCOP_TAC proofs (it needed while loops, lazy values,
  Hashtbl with OCaml's shadowing semantics, local opens, `include` of a
  translated module, and fixpoint bounds for recursive groups). Known
  limitation: Hashtbl.hash of float arrays is that of an ordinary block.
  Further known limits (each fails loudly or was checked not to matter
  where used): `num` keeps no representation history, so
  OCaml's structural compare and Hashtbl.hash on nums are reproduced from
  the canonical form (a non-normalized Big_int such as `minus_num (2^62)`
  differs) and where OCaml's compare raises on big-integer digits the port
  aborts; simp's generic net elements order equal-priority payloads by
  physical identity only (upstream compares non-closure payloads
  structurally; HOL's nets hold closures); a net whose elements are
  tuples holding a function compares them by identity as a whole
  (Examples/holby.ml); byte-level string operations
  abort on non-ASCII characters (e.g. dest_string of a char >= 128).
  The core (everything hol.ml loads before the theory files) is now
  ported. All theory files hol.ml loads are translated and match upstream
  in their differential tests: pair, compute, nums, recursion, arith, wf,
  calc_num, normalizer, grobner, ind_types, lists, realax, calc_int,
  realarith, real, calc_rat, int, sets, iterate, cart, define (theorem
  lists plus behaviour checks: EVAL_CONV, NUM_REDUCE_CONV,
  NUM_NORMALIZE_CONV, NUM_RING, define_type, REAL_ARITH, REAL_FIELD,
  INT_ARITH, INT_RING, general recursive `define`). They are produced by
  tools/ocaml_ref/theory.sh <file> <dependencies...> (now
  tools/ocaml_ref/theory.py <file>, which follows `needs`).
  Library/ is translated and matches upstream file by file (each package
  has `load()`, loading its `needs` first and itself once, so theories
  load in upstream order). External programs: wasm has no shell or file
  system, so `gp factorint` (pocklington, pratt) is emulated in
  lib/gp.mbt (Baillie-PSW + Brent rho) over in-memory files. Not ported:
  Library/tactician_light.ml, an interactive tool that evaluates OCaml
  tactic strings at run time with `loadt` (it needs a tactic-expression
  interpreter, a possible later addition).
  OCaml `int` is an `Int64` with exact 63-bit semantics (lib/int63.mbt:
  results normalized to [-2^62, 2^62 - 1], OCaml's `max_int`/`min_int`,
  `lsl`/`lsr`/`asr`, division by zero raising; checked against OCaml
  4.14). The translator maps `int` to `Int64` and converts at the
  boundaries of hand-ported `Int` APIs (scalars, tuples and functions;
  `Int` stays for indexes and bounded internals, narrowed with a check);
  APIs carrying OCaml ints inside data are `Int64` (kernel type arities,
  `range`, infix precedences, instantiations, `Num.int_of_num` as
  `int63_of_num`). Upstream and the port now agree beyond 2^31 (e.g.
  bitmatch on 32-bit word numerals). tools/ocaml_ref/retranslate_all.py
  regenerates every translated package in load order.
  Multivariate/ loads in make.ml's order (each file after its
  predecessor's chain and what it needs), checked a run of files at a time
  by tools/ocaml_ref/batch.py (one translation session and one upstream
  session, forking a child per file, instead of three chain reloads per
  file). Not ported: multivariate_database.ml and complex_database.ml, the
  name/theorem tables of the interactive `search` (they need help.ml, like
  database.ml, and define no theory). Native: `--target native` passes the
  whole suite; `--release` hits a moonc C-backend miscompile
  (tools/moonbit_bugs/).
  Multivariate/ is translated and matches upstream file by file: the 20
  files make.ml and make_complex.ml load, and the 12 others, each loaded
  after its anchor (the deepest make.ml file it needs; e.g. tarski.ml's
  proofs fail after the complex analysis). batch.py plans a run of files as
  a tree (branches fork the session) so a chain loads once per side. The
  whole suite (145 tests) passes with `moon test -j 16`.
  Not ported because they fail upstream (HOL Light 3.1.0, OCaml 4.14, in
  upstream's own hol_lib.ml environment): 100/e_is_transcendental.ml
  (ACCEPT_TAC fails; 100/transcendence.ml proves the result independently).
