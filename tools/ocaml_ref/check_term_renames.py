"""Check that the term-variable renames change only names.

usage: check_term_renames.py [<name>_ref.ml ...]

Runs each reference script (by default, every one that loads a file
TERM_RENAMES lists, term_renames.py) twice with run.sh, with
HOL_REF_ORIGINAL_TERM_NAMES set and unset (type renames apply to both). For
the script of a renamed file, the renamed run's output must be exactly the
original's with that file's variables renamed (term_renames.renamed_output:
its quotation trace and the variables of its theorems), none of the new
names may occur in the original's and none of the old in the renamed one's.
A script that only loads a renamed file must print exactly what it did: its
theorems are its own, and a variable they take from the renamed file would
show the rename. Any other difference, such as a proof search that orders
terms by name (fn sorts before fn0, fn_ after it), fails.
